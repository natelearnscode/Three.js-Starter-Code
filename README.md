# Three.js Starter Code

This repo contains starter code that can be used to create a simple three.js application with a scene with models and animations. This code was creating using a tutorial series at https://discoverthreejs.com/book/. I highly recommend this series for anyone hoping to get started using three.js. Note: For more complex applications, you may want to add support for additional libraries/tools such as webpack, node.js, a physics engine (like ammo.js), etc. Additionally, I have chosen to use a cdn to get the three.js javascript code for my application, but you may decide to another method.

## Installation

To develop three.js applications locally, you must use a local server to serve the html, css, and javascript code. This can be done using a variety of methods. I have opted to use a python script called dev_server.py, but using another method like node.js should work as well. To use the script you must have python3 installed. You can install it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

## Usage
To start the server:

```
python dev_server.py

```

Then navigate to http://localhost:1337/ to view the application.
